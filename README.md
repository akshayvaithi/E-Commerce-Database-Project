# E-Commerce Data Analytics Project

In this project for my Database Technologies course, I created an e-commerce database in MySQL & utilized SQL queries to extract critical business insights. The purpose of creating this database is to allow e-commerce platforms in the United States to store information about products and collect information about purchases.
